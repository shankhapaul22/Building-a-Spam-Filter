We will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm so:
1. The computer learns how humans classify messages.
2. Then it uses that human knowledge to estimate probabilities for new messages — probabilities for spam and non-spam.
3. Finally, the computer classifies a new message based on the probability values it calculated in step 2 — if the probability for spam is greater, then it classifies the message as spam. Otherwise, it classifies it as non-spam.
